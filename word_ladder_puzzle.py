"""Word ladder module.

Your task is to complete the implementation of this class so that
you can use it to play Word Ladder in your game program.

Rules of Word Ladder
--------------------
1. You are given a start word and a target word (all words in this puzzle
   are lowercase).
2. Your goal is to reach the target word by making a series of *legal moves*,
   beginning from the start word.
3. A legal move at the current word is to change ONE letter to get
   a current new word, where the new word must be a valid English word.

The sequence of words from the start to the target is called
a "word ladder," hence the name of the puzzle.

Example:
    Start word: 'make'
    Target word: 'cure'
    Solution:
        make
        bake
        bare
        care
        cure

    Note that there are many possible solutions, and in fact a shorter one
    exists for the above puzzle. Do you see it?

Implementation details:
- We have provided some starter code in the constructor which reads in a list
  of valid English words from wordsEn.txt. You should use this list to
  determine what moves are valid.
- **WARNING**: unlike Sudoku, Word Ladder has the possibility of getting
  into infinite recursion if you aren't careful. The puzzle state
  should keep track not just of the current word, but all words
  in the ladder. This way, in the 'extensions' method you can just
  return the possible new words which haven't already been used.
